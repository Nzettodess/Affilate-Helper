# Affiliate-Helper

**Affiliate-Helper** is an automation tool designed to simulate real web traffic through affiliate URLs. It scrapes public proxies and performs automated visits to your custom affiliate links using GitHub Actions or Windows Task Scheduler. This tool is best used on affiliate systems that do not implement strong bot detection or use headless-resistant tracking (like Google Analytics, Cloudflare, etc.).
